in async js fetch, axios, setTimout, setInterval etc will send the code/data to run process.
When this process is done, who will execute the code dependent on this process.
Here we use:
then catch
callbacks
async await

so, callback is the function that execute only when the async code is completed.

syntax: setTimeout(callback, time in miliseconds)

setTimeout(function(){

}, 10000)

so function above is callback function that will run after setTimeout is completed within 10 seconds.
