Execution context: Every function contains its imagenary container that holds three things:
1) variables
2) functions inside it 
3) lexical environment of that function


Lexical Environment: What things/data can be accessed in this function and what can't. It containes scope and scope chain (scope of nested functions).

function abcd(){
    var a = 12;

    function def(){
        var b = 23;
    }
}

now lexical environment of function abcd will bound abcd to not access b variable. Because var b ka scope apny function tk he.
