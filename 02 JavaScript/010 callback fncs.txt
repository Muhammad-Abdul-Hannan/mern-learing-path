callback functions: any code that run/execute after some event/time, JS does not know it is completed or not, so this code/function tells JS that it(event or time) is completed. this is called callback. Mean telling JS that I am ready to run my event has occured.


example:
setTimeout(function(){
    code to run after 2 sec.
}, 2000);
Here setTimeout mean run function after 2 seconds.

Now, when 2 seconds will be completed, callback function will tell JS that run this code.
