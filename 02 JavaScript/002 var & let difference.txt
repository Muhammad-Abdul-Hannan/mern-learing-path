var and let difference:
var is from es5. let and const is from es6.
var is function scoped. let braces scoped.

function abcd(){
    var a = 12;
    // this a can be used anywhere in this function.

    for(var i = 1; i<12; i++){
        console.log(i);
    }
    console.log(i); // this result in 12.
    // this i will also be printed. Var can be used in its parent function anywhere. Mean i is not bound to for loop. i can be used anywhere inside abcd().

    for(let j=1; j<12; j++){
        console.log(j);
    }
    console.log(j); //this will make error. let j can be just used in for loop braces.
}
var add itself to window object.
let and const doesn't adds to window object.
