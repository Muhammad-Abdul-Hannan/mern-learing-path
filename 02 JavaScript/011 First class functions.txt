When function is used as a value, it is called first class function. When the function is treated as variable (you can save them, you can pass them as argument), this is known as first class function.

var a = function(){
    code;
};

or

function abcd(a){
    a();
    // here a is a function because we have passed function as prameter.
}

abcd(function(){console.log("yes");})
