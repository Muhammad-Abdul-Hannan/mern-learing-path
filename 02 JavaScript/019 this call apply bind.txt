this is global and local scope:

Global scope: when variable is not inside {} it is said to be global scope.

Local scope: When variable is inside {} it is said to be in local scope.

In global scope: 
console.log(this) // this return window

In function scope:
console.log(this) // this return window

function abcd(){
    console.log(this);
}

in method scope: any function inside object is known as method.
var obj = {
    name: "Ali",
    abcd: function(){
        console.log(this)
    }
}
obj.abcd();

Here this return object.


IMPORTANT: in any method 'this' keyword always refer to parent object.



in event listner:
var button = document.querySelector("button");
button.addEventListener("click", function(){
    console.log(this);
    this.style.color = 'red';
})
this keyword is equal to whatever written before addEventListener, in this case is button.


=========================================

Call, Apply and Bind: When you want to change the value of 'this', we use call, apply and bind methods.

For example: you have a function and an object. You want to run the function and you want to refer 'this' to object instead of window (window is by default see above in function scope).

function abcd(){
    console.log(this.age);
}

var obj = {
    age: 24;
}

abcd.call(obj); // here we bound 'this' to refer to object obj. So, this.age will give 24.

What if you have aurguments to pass to function.

function abcd(val1, val2){
    console.log(this.age);
}
var obj = {
    age: 24;
}

abcd.call(obj, 23, 45) // now obj will goto 'this', 23 to val1 and 45 to val2.

Apply: in apply method aurguments are sent in array. So, above function will be called with statement like:
abcd.apply(obj, [23, 45]);


Bind: bind method just bind the function and object but not run it. You will need to store it (binded function and object) into variable and then run it.

function abcd(val1, val2){
    console.log(this);
}
var obj = {
    age: 24;
}

abcd.bind(obj);

above statement will not run. It will just bind. To run you will need statement like:

var bindedfnc = abcd.bind(obj);
bindedfnc(); // it will run the function binded with object.
