JS does not contain all functions/features. It borrows the freatures from window/browser and use it.
window contains many more features that are used by JS.

example: alert, print, prompt all these are window features.

type in console:
window and press enter you will see all features/functions of window object.
If you declare and define a var it is also added to this window object. This is against security so let and const does not add to window object.
