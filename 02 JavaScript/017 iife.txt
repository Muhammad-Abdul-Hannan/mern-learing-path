iife => immediately invoked function expression.
It means executing function immediately in such a way that we create private variable. it is function inside ().
Below is privateVal variable. It is private variable that can't be accessed outside the function. For accessing it outside, we use getter in return.

var ans = (function(){
    var privateVal = 12;

    return {
        getter: function(){
            console.log(privateVal);
        }
    },
    setter: function(val){
        privateVal = val;
    }
    // here setter is used to change value of private variable.
})()

ans.getter()

ans.setter(22)
