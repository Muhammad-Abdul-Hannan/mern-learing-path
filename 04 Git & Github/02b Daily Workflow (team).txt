# ============================================================
# COMPLETE TEAM GIT WORKFLOW (REALISTIC FLOW VERSION)
# From project creation → coding → PR → merge → cleanup
# ============================================================



# ============================================================
# PHASE 1 — PROJECT CREATION (DONE BY MANAGER / TEAM LEAD)
# ============================================================

# 👨‍💼 Manager creates project locally:
# - Creates folder
# - Adds HTML, CSS, JS, folder structure
# - Adds README.md

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project setup"

# 👨‍💼 Manager creates new repository on GitHub (website)

# 👨‍💼 Connect local project to GitHub:
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/reponame.git
git push -u origin main

# ✅ Now main branch exists on GitHub
# 👨‍💼 Manager goes to:
# GitHub → Settings → Collaborators → Add team members



# ============================================================
# PHASE 2 — TEAM MEMBER FIRST TIME SETUP
# ============================================================

# 👨‍💻 Developer clones the project
git clone <repo_url>
cd <project_folder>

# Now you have main branch locally



# ============================================================
# PHASE 3 — STARTING WORK (VERY IMPORTANT FLOW)
# ============================================================

# 🟢 Every morning / before starting new feature:

# Step 1: Go to main
git checkout main

# Step 2: Get latest updates
git pull origin main

# 🔥 IMPORTANT:
# NOW main is updated.
# DO NOT CODE YET.


# Step 3: Create your own branch
git checkout -b feature/login-form

# 🔥 NOW YOU START CODING.
# This is where you build your feature.
# You may code for hours or days.



# ============================================================
# PHASE 4 — DURING CODING (YOUR DAILY WORK)
# ============================================================

# After writing some code:

git status
git add .
git commit -m "Add login form UI"

# Continue coding...

git add .
git commit -m "Add validation logic"

# You can commit multiple times while building feature.



# ============================================================
# PHASE 5 — PUSH YOUR WORK TO GITHUB
# ============================================================

# First time push (connects branch to GitHub)
git push -u origin feature/login-form

# After that, future pushes:
git push

# 🔥 Now your branch is visible on GitHub.



# ============================================================
# PHASE 6 — CREATE PULL REQUEST (ON GITHUB WEBSITE)
# ============================================================

# 👨‍💻 You go to GitHub
# Click "Compare & Pull Request"
# Write description:
# "Added login form with validation"
# Click "Create Pull Request"

# 👨‍💼 Admin / Team reviews code:
# - Checks logic
# - Suggests changes (if needed)
# - Approves PR

# 👨‍💼 Admin clicks "Merge"


🧠 How Does Admin Verify?
There are 3 common ways (real world):

1️⃣ Basic Review (Most Common)
Admin just checks:
Code logic
Structure
Naming
Security issues
Bad practices
Unnecessary console.logs
Formatting

All directly on GitHub UI.
No cloning needed.
For small changes, this is enough.

2️⃣ Pull the Branch Locally (Common in Serious Projects)
If feature is important:
Admin can run:
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git fetch
git checkout feature/login

Then he:
Runs the project
Tests the feature
Checks if it breaks anything
This is very common in bigger teams.

3️⃣ Automatic Testing (Very Professional Teams)
Some teams use:
GitHub Actions
CI/CD pipelines

When you create PR:
Tests run automatically
Linting runs
Build runs
If tests fail → cannot merge

In that case admin may not even manually test.

💡 Does GitHub Create Copy?
Not exactly a copy.
It just compares:
main ←→ feature/login




# ============================================================
# PHASE 7 — AFTER MERGE (VERY IMPORTANT)
# ============================================================

# Your feature is now inside main on GitHub.

# 🟢 Now you must update your local main:

git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Delete your feature branch (cleaning)
git branch -d feature/login-form

# (Optional) Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete feature/login-form



# ============================================================
# PHASE 8 — WHAT IF SOMEONE MERGES WHILE YOU ARE CODING?
# ============================================================

# Suppose another developer merged dashboard feature.
# Your branch is now outdated.

# Step 1: Update main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Step 2: Merge main into your branch
git checkout feature/login-form
git merge main

# If conflict appears:
# - Fix manually
# - Then:
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"

git push



# ============================================================
# SIMPLE HUMAN FLOW SUMMARY
# ============================================================

# 👨‍💼 Manager:
# - Creates repo
# - Adds collaborators
# - Reviews PR
# - Merges PR

# 👨‍💻 Developer:
# - Clone repo
# - Update main
# - Create branch
# - CODE HERE
# - Commit
# - Push
# - Create PR
# - Wait for review
# - Update main after merge



# ============================================================
# GOLDEN RULES
# ============================================================

# ❌ Never code on main
# ❌ Never push directly to main
# ✅ Always create branch before coding
# ✅ Always pull latest main before creating branch
# ✅ Delete branch after merge
# ============================================================
